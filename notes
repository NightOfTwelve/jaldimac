hw.h

requirements:
- pure net_device that provides a point for click to inject raw packets (including timestamps) and send over the air. base driver should simply initialize the hardware, provide an interface for sending packets (expecting a specific header format), and register an interrupt handler for receipt of packets. Rx must report back relevant device information, and there must be a straightforward way to set channel, etc.
