- Add support for bulk ACKs - or, indeed, any ACKs at all!
- Make a drop front variant of JaldiQueue for use with VoIP flows.
- For VoIP, it makes sense to delay filling out the slot until the last possible moment. In the short term, could probably hack something together to plan the rest of the round out in advance while only filling in VoIP slots dynamically, but this suggests to me that in the long term a better design would be to do the whole schedule calculation online.
- Complete this TODO list. =)
